Problem specification : Using logical operators 
Implementation :
class Ex07
{
	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		int x=10;
		int y=5;
		
		System.out.println("Addition is : "+(x+y));
		System.out.println("Substraction is : "+(x-y));
		System.out.println("Multiplication is : "+(x*y));
		System.out.println("Division is : "+(x/y));
		System.out.println("Modulus is : "+(x%y));
	}
}
Output : 
Addition is : 15
Substraction is : 5
Multiplication is : 50
Division is : 2
Modulus is : 0
Conclusion : Learn how to use logical operators
